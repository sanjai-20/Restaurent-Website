This is a simple and responsive restaurant website built using only HTML and CSS. It includes multiple sections like Home, Menu, About, and Contact, designed to showcase a restaurantâ€™s services in a clean and modern layout. The site is fully responsive and works well on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices. Features include smooth navigation, elegant hover effects, and a professional footer with social media icons. The project uses HTML5 for structure and CSS3 (with Flexbox and media queries) for styling and responsiveness. It serves as a great beginner-level web design project or portfolio piece. You can easily clone the repository, open the index.html file in your browser, and customize the content or styles as needed. This website is a good starting point for anyone looking to create a static food or restaurant website using just front-end technologies.
